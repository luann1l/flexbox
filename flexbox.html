            <p>Cinnamoroll (シナモロール), or otherwise referred to his real name as Cinnamon (シナモン), is a Sanrio character and the main protagonist of the Cinnamoroll universe. Debuted in 2002, he was born on March 6, on a cloud far up in the sky. Cinnamoroll is a small, shy and chubby dog with white fur, blue eyes, pink cheeks, a plump and curly tail that resembles a cinnamon roll (hence his name), and long and thick ears that enable him to fly. Cinnamon is shy but pure-hearted, and always willing to help out his friends when they need it. He works at Café Cinnamon, and sometimes sleeps on customers laps. His favorite food is, ironically enough, warm, fresh cinnamon rolls.</p>

            <p>Cinnamon is often depicted living in a peaceful, whimsical world where he embarks on various adventures with his friends, which include Chiffon, Mocha, Espresso, Cappuccino, and Milk. Although each of these characters closely resemble Cinnamoroll, they are uniquely designed with their own personalities, rather than being just side characters who often get sidelined for Cinnamon himself, making them worth being characters in their own right.</p>
